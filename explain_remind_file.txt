creating a remainder file that ask user to selected which time they will like to be reminded from 5 minutes to 30 minutes 
creating a reminder file that ask the user if they want to set a reminder 
creating a reminder file that prompt the user to input the time they will like to be reminded
creating a module for  the reminder 

syntax
using match case after asking user if user want to set a reminder and using break to break the file if yes or no and if user enter something different from that the code is keep repeating until user click either yes/no
match
   case"yes":
    break
   case"no":
     print("No reminder set. Exiting.")
    break 
   case _: 
    print("Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.") 


defining a function that ask user the time of the reminder in 12--hours format
using the datetime modules to check if the time is in 12--hours format and print ValueError


modules for 5 minutes before the time 
using the time , datetime, timedelta modules,
using the get_time_input modules created by me that ask user if they want to set a reminder and the time for the reminder
using datetime.now.date to get the current date and time 
using timedelta to check if time is in the present or the past
using timedelta to to subtract 5 minutes before the user reminder  time so that it will remind user 5 minutes before the user set time 
using time.sleep to sleep the code for another 5 minute so that it will remind the user the time user set for the reminder
and using break to break the code to prevent continues execution

modules for 10 minutes before the time  
using the time , datetime, timedelta modules,
using the get_time_input modules created by me that ask user if they want to set a reminder and the time for the reminder
using datetime.now.date to get the current date and time 
using timedelta to check if time is in the present or the past
using timedelta to to subtract 10 minutes before the user reminder  time so that it will remind user 10 minutes before the user set time 
using time.sleep to sleep the code for another 10 minute so that it will remind the user the time user set for the reminder
and using break to break the code to prevent continues execution

modules for 15 minutes before the time 
using the time , datetime, timedelta modules,
using the get_time_input modules created by me that ask user if they want to set a reminder and the time for the reminder

using timedelta to check if time is in the present or the past
using timedelta to to subtract 15 minutes before the user reminder  time so that it will remind user 15 minutes before the user set time 
using time.sleep to sleep the code for another 15 minute so that it will remind the user the time user set for the reminder
and using break to break the code to prevent continues execution

modules for 20 minutes before the time 
using the time , datetime, timedelta modules,
using the get_time_input modules created by me that ask user if they want to set a reminder and the time for the reminder
using datetime.now.date to get the current date and time 
using timedelta to check if time is in the present or the past
using timedelta to to subtract 20 minutes before the user reminder  time so that it will remind user 20 minutes before the user set time 
using time.sleep to sleep the code for another 20 minute so that it will remind the user the time user set for the reminder
and using break to break the code to prevent continues execution

modules for 25 minutes before the time 
using the time , datetime, timedelta modules,
using the get_time_input modules created by me that ask user if they want to set a reminder and the time for the reminder
using datetime.now.date to get the current date and time 
using timedelta to check if time is in the present or the past
using timedelta to to subtract 25 minutes before the user reminder  time so that it will remind user 25 minutes before the user set time 
using time.sleep to sleep the code for another 25 minute so that it will remind the user the time user set for the reminder
and using break to break the code to prevent continues execution

modules for 30 minutes before the time 
using the time , datetime, timedelta modules,
using the get_time_input modules created by me that ask user if they want to set a reminder and the time for the reminder
using datetime.now.date to get the current date and time 
using timedelta to check if time is in the present or the past
using timedelta to to subtract 30 minutes before the user reminder  time so that it will remind user 30 minutes before the user set time 
using time.sleep to sleep the code for another 30 minute so that it will remind the user the time user set for the reminder
and using break to break the code to prevent continues execution

craeting a main file for the execution the code
importing modules for 5 minutes
importing modules for 10 minutes
importing modules for 15 minutes
importing modules for 20 minutes
importing modules for 25 minutes
importing modules for 30 minutes
prompt user to selct 1 - 6  according to the time they will like to be reminded
1 for 5 minutes before
2 for 10 minutes before
3 for 15 minutes before
4 for 20 minutes before
5 for 25 minutes before
6 for 30 minutes before

using match case to run the code according to user selection, also handling if the user select a wrong choice 
match choice:
   case"1":
      reaminder_5_minutes.main()
   case "2":
        reminder_10_minutes.main()
    case "3":
        reminder_15_minutes.main()
    case "4":
        reminder_20_minutes.main()
    case "5":
        remider_25_minutes.main()
    case "6":
        reminder_30_minutes.main()   
    case_:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")                     
        main()
